# Challenge-programming-fullstack-1.2.0

This project is a challenge answer requested by Hubla. The objective of this
test is to evaluate my programming skills.

## Software Description

```
A new urgent demand has arisen and we need an exclusive area to upload a file of transactions made in the sale of products by Hubla customers.

Our platform works on the creator-affiliate model, so a creator can sell their products and have one or more affiliates also selling those products, as long as a commission is paid per sale.

A financial transaction is a purchase and sale contract. In the context of the statement, we will consider that each transaction results in a change in the balance, which can be from the producer or affiliate.

My task was to build a web interface that allows the upload of a file of transactions of sold products, normalize the data, and store it in a relational database.

I used the sales.txt file to test the application. The format is described in the section "Format of the input file".

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

See **[Deployment](#-deployment)** for notes on how to deploy the project.

### üìã Prerequisites

```
Visual Studio Code
Docker Desktop

```

### üîß Installation

```
Execute the cloning of the repository with *git -clone https://github.com/caiocesar333/desafio-programacao-fullstack-1.2.0*

After cloning the repository, open the folder in VSCode

---

For backend:

*cd backend*

*Build SQL database with Docker*

*npm install* to install dependencies

*npm run start:dev* to build the project

---

For Frontend

*cd frontend*

*cd react-ts*

*npm install* to install dependencies

*npm run dev* to start development server

*npm build*  to build vite and tsc project

---

```

Sure, here is the Docker section in markdown format:

## üê≥ Docker

This application can be run inside a Docker container. To build and run the
container, follow the steps below:

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Build the Docker image with the following command:

```
docker build -t mongo:latest .
```

4. Run the Docker container with the following command:

```
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

This will start the container and map port 27017 from the container to port
27017 on your local machine. You can then access the application by navigating
to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
